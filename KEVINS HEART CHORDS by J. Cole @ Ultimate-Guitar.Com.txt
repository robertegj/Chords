[Pre-Chorus]
F#m
She my number one, I don't need nothing on the side
D                                  A
Said that I was done for good and don't want no more lies
F#m
But my phone be blowing up, temptations on my line
D                               A
I stare at the screen a while before I press decline
F#m
But she plants a seed and it still lingers in my mind
D                                  A
Told myself I'm strong enough to shake it and I'm trying
F#m
But I'm only human, I know loving you's a crime
D                              A
If I take this cookie now one day I'll do the time
 
[Chorus]
F#m
Slip me a xanny at once (somebody)
I got the earth in a blunt (smoke)
D
I get the skirt when I want (skrrt!)
A
I get the skirt when I want (skrrt!)
F#m
Due to the money aroma (somebody)
My girl she got a diploma (smoke)
D
She got wife written all over
A
She got wife written all over
 
[Verse 1]
F#m
All a nigga know is how to fuck a good thing up
Run from the pain, sip lean, smoke tree up
D
When I'm in your town press pound hit me up
A
When I'm in your town press pound hit me up
F#m
Only if you down and you slurp good D up
If the work good I'll be back for the re-up
D
Hate when I creep and the phone wake me up
A
Fake like I'm sleep knowing damn well I be up
F#m
Monkey on my back and I walk a hundred miles
Guilt make a nigga feel fake when he smile
D
Love get confused in the mind of a child
         A
'Cause love wouldn't lie like I lie and it's wild
F#m
Wanna have my cake and another cake too
Even if the baker don't bake like you
D
Even when the flavor don't taste like you
A
So I'm back mobbing with the late night crew
F#m
All in your mind with fears that would come true
D                          A
The back of my mind, the back of my mind was you
F#m
Wishing that I could blind myself from view
N.C.
And only have eyes, and only have eyes for you
 
[Chorus]
F#m
Slip me a xanny at once (somebody)
I got the earth in a blunt (smoke)
D
I get the skirt when I want (skrrt!)
A
I get the skirt when I want (skrrt!)
F#m
Due to the money aroma (somebody)
My girl she got a diploma (smoke)
D
She got wife written all over
A
She got wife written all over
 
[Bridge]
F#m
I'm a fake nigga and it's never been clearer
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
D
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
A
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
F#m
I'm a fake nigga and it's never been clearer
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
D
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
A
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
 
[Pre-Chorus]
F#m
She my number one, I don't need nothing on the side
D                                  A
Said that I was done for good and don't want no more lies
F#m
But my phone be blowing up, temptations on my line
D                               A

F#m
But she plants a seed and it still lingers in my mind
D                                  A
Told myself I'm strong enough to shake it and I'm trying
F#m
But I'm only human, I know loving you's a crime
N.C.
If I take this cookie now one day I'll do the time
 
[Verse 2]
  F#m
I love her, I don't want to lose her
I'm selfish, I know that I use her
    D
My ego get stroked and I bruise her
    A
My ego get stroked and I bruise her
   F#m
My actions I know they confusin'
At home I look happy as usual
        D
On the road I'm a mack, I'm a chooser
        A
I'm a addict, I'm maskin' that

N.C.
They tell me "What's done in the dark
Will find a way to shine"
N.C.
I done did so much that when you see you might go blind
What's done in the dark will always find a way to shine
I done did so much that when you see you might go blind
