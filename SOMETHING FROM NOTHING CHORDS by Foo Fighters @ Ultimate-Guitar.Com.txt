IMO, the best band ever - Foo Fighters. This is the first released song from their album 'Sonic Highways'.
Hopefully the chords aren't too inaccurate.
 
Standard Tuning
No Capo
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
Em                     D#
Give me the flammable life
                                 A7
G
I'm cold as a match ready to strike
   C   A7  A
So here I  go
Em                  D#
Here lies a city on fire
G
Singing along
             A7
The arsonist choir
    C    A7 A
Now here I  go
E F# G D (A) <--- A is played on the next line
A
It's starting with a spark
E F# G D (A)
A
And burned into the dark
    C   A7  A
Now here I  go
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
Em                 D#                G
There is a river I found into the wild
A7
Under the ground
   C   A7  A
So here I  go
 
E F# G D (A)
A
A button on a string
E F# G D (A)
A
And I heard everything
    C   A7  A
Now here I  go
 
E E E F# G (x4)
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
E        E        E  F# G
Oh sweet ignition be my fuse
E           E          E    F# G
You have no choice you have to choose
E         E     E  F#  G
Bid farewell to yesterday
E         E     E  F#  G
Say goodbye I'm on my way
 
 
[Chorus]
 
C G D
D
But in the end we all
C G D
D
Come from what's come before
   C   A7  A
So here I  go
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
E E E F# G
 
E        E        E  F# G
Oh sweet ignition be my fuse
E           E          E    F# G
You have no choice you have to choose
E         E     E  F#  G
Bid farewell to yesterday
E         E     E  F#  G
Say goodbye I'm on my way
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
E          E    E   F#  G
I threw it all away because
E        E       E  F#  G
I had to be what never was
E       E      E  F#  G
Been so hungry I could lie
E       E       E    F#  G
Took my word, I took your lie
E           E       E   F# G
In held you with my bloody hands
E           E          E    F# G
These rattle bones and rubber bands
E          E      E  F#  G
Wash them in the muddy water
E             E        E      F#  G
Looking for a dime and found a quarter
 
 
[Bridge]
 
E             E       E      F#  G
But you can't make me change my name
E          E         E      F#  G
You'll never make me change my name
E        E       E    F#   G
Pay no mind now ain't that something
E        E    E    F#   G
Fuck it all I came from nothing
 
E D A7 A7 C A# A G
 
 
[Hook]
 
E           D  A7
I'm something
            A7 C
From nothing
        A# A    G
You are my fuse
E            D  A7
I'm something
           A7 C
From nothing
         A# A   G
You are my fuse
        E  E  E
It goes oh oh oh 
E  E  E
oh oh oh
E  E  E
oh oh oh 
        E  E  E
It goes oh oh oh      alright
 
E E E F# G (8)

E            E       E      F# G
No you can't make me change my name
E      E     E       E      F# G
You'll never make me change my name
E        E      E     F#   G
Pay no mind now ain't that something
E       E     E    F#   G
Fuck it all I came from nothing
 
 
[Outtro]
 
E   E  F# G
I'm something

From nothing

I'm something
E E  E F# G
From nothing
