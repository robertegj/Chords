[Verse 1]
                      G          Bmadd11
And you don't seem to understand
                      Em         Bmadd11
A shame you seemed an honest man
                      G            Bmadd11
And all the fears you hold so dear
                     Em          Bmadd11
Will turn to whisper in your ear
                                 G
And you know what they say might hurt you
                              Bm
And you know that it means so much
                   Em           Bm7
And you don't even feel a thing
 
[Chorus]
     Em7      Bm7  G
I am falling, I am fading
       Em7       Bm7  G
I have lost it all
 
[Verse 2]
                       G          Bmadd11
And you don't seem the lying kind
                   Em             Bmadd11
A shame then I can read your mind
                        G            Bmadd11
And all the things that I read there
                     Em            Bmadd11
Candlelit smile that we both share
                             G
And you know I don't mean to hurt you
                              Bm
But you know that it means so much
                   Em          Bm7
And you don't even feel a thing
 
[Chorus]
     Em7      Bm7  G            Em7
I am falling, I am fading, I am drowning
Bm7        G
Help me to breathe
 
     Em7      Bm7    G
I am hurting, I have lost it all
     Em7
I am losing
Bm7        G
Help me to breathe
