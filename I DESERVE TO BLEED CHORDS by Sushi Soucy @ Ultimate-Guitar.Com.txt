[Verse 1]
  F             G              C                 Am
I wanna rip out my intestines, throw them in the sea
        F               G            C            Am
I wanna raise the money to invest in plastic surgery
        F            G              C          A
I wanna cover myself head to toe in super sexy scars
            F                      G                C
'cuz I mean aren't you supposed to burn if you're a star?
 
[Chorus]
Em           B          C           G
I want to be torn apart excruciatingly
Em            B                C               G
I punish my body 'cuz it's not good enough for me
    D                  B                Em
The scary thoughts are spreading like a weed
    C                      Cm           G
The thoughts that say that I deserve to bleed
 
[Verse 2]
  F            G                C              Am
I wanna take a knife and draw a line across my chest
        F                G              C          Am
I wanna feel much better than I do when I am at my best
        F              G               C             A
I wanna fly away from my own skin and find a better place
        F                 G             C
I wanna slash across what used to be my face
 
[Chorus]
Em           B          C           G
I want to be torn apart excruciatingly
Em            B                C               G
I punish my body 'cuz it's not good enough for me
    D                  B                Em
The scary thoughts are spreading like a weed
    C                      Cm           G
The thoughts that say that I deserve to bleed
 
[Bridge]
     F                A            D                B
They say that it gets better but I guess that was a lie
  C                 D                G
I guess we all just fake it 'till we die
F            A           D                 B
Sympathy and love we can extend to someone else
           C              D               G
But it's harder when you have to love yourself
 
[Chorus]
Em           B          C           G
I want to be torn apart excruciatingly
Em            B                C               G
I punish my body 'cuz it's not good enough for me
    D                  B                Em
The scary thoughts are spreading like a weed
    C                      Cm           G
The thoughts that say that I deserve to bleed
    C                      Cm           G
The thoughts that say that I deserve to bleed
    C                      Cm           G
The thoughts that say that I deserve to bleed
