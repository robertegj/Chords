# Guitar-Chords
## What is it?
Here's a place for guitar chords.  
No ads or anything annoying.  

It's meant to be small and portable, for offline usage.   

## How do I use it?
Here's a link to a hosted version.  

To download it locally for offline usage simply download this repo.

To add new chords, run the "get-chords-from-URLs.py" script after updating the list of URLs. 
  Note: this script will look for an element called <pre> and will scrape it. This should grab any preformatted text (usually chords)

... then run the update-manifest script to update the html file. 
This file will act as your homepage.
