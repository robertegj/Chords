Db Eb Ab Fm Db Eb Ab
 
[Chorus]
E               G#7                C#m   A
All my favorite songs are slow and sad
E               G#7            C#m   A
All my favorite people make me mad
E               G#7              C#m       A
Everything that feels so good is bad, bad, bad
E               G#7                C#m
All my favorite songs are slow and sad
A                              E    G#7       C#m
I don't know what's wrong with me (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
A                              E    G#7       C#m
I don't know what's wrong with me (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
 
[Verse 1]
       E              G#7
I love parties, but I don't go
       C#m             A
Then I feel bad when I stay home
         E                    G#7
'Cause I need a friend when I take a walk
       C#m                  A
I like spacin' out when somebody talks
E          G#7  C#m         A
I wanna be rich, but I feel guilty
E              G#7  C#m          A
I fall in love with everyone who hates me
 
[Chorus]
E               G#7                C#m   A
All my favorite songs are slow and sad
E               G#7            C#m     A
All my favorite people make me mad, so mad
E               G#7              C#m       A
Everything that feels so good is bad, bad, bad
E               G#7                C#m
All my favorite songs are slow and sad
A                              E    G#7       C#m
I don't know what's wrong with me (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
A                              E    G#7       C#m
I don't know what's wrong with me (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
 
[Verse 2]
E      G#7
Dreamy morning
C#m      A         E
Walkin' alone by myself
          G#7
Thinkin' about life
C#m           A                   E
And tryin' to find my way through hell
            G#7
Sometimes I wish
C#m         A
I was on an island
E            G#7
But then I'd miss
C#m          A
The sound of sirens
 
[Chorus]
E               G#7                C#m   A
All my favorite songs are slow and sad
E               G#7            C#m     A
All my favorite people make me mad, so mad
E               G#7              C#m       A
Everything that feels so good is bad, bad, bad
E               G#7                C#m
All my favorite songs are slow and sad
A                              E
I don't know what's wrong with me
G#7                            C#m
I don't know what's wrong with me
A                              E    G#7       C#m
I don't know what's wrong with me (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
 
[Outro]
A             E         G#7       C#m
Woah, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
A             E         G#7       C#m
Woah, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
