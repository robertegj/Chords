Audioslave - Like a Stone
Capo 3

Verse 1:

Em          D
On a cobweb afternoon
Bm7               C
In a room full of emptiness
Em           D
By a freeway I confess
Bm7               C
I was lost in the pages
Em         D
Of a book full of death
Bm7               C
Reading how we'll die alone
Em                D
And if we're good we'll lay to rest
Bm7         C
Anywhere we want to go

Chorus:

Em      G
In your house
D         Em
I long to be
Em      G
Room by room
D       Em
Patiently
C                 Em
I'll wait for you there
D      Em
Like a stone
C                 Em
I'll wait for you there
B      B
Alone.....

Verse 2:

Em                   D
And on my death bed I will pray to
Bm7              C
The gods and the angels
Em           D
Like a pagan to anyone who will
Bm7        C
Take me to heaven
Em              D
Took to a place I recall
Bm7            C
I was there so long ago
Em                   D
The sky was bruised, the wine was bled
Bm7                  C
And there you led me on

Chorus

Bridge:

C      G
And on I read
B                C
Till the day was gone
Cm           Am
And I sat in regret
B                  Em
For all the things I've done
C                 G
For all that I've blessed
B                 C
And all that I've wronged
Cm                    Am
In my dreams until my death
B     B
I will wander on...

Chorus(last):

Em      G
In your house
D         Em
I long to be
Em      G
Room by room
D      Em
Patiently
C                 Em
I'll wait for you there
D      Em
Like a stone
C                 Em
I'll wait for you there
B      B
Alone, Alone
B      Em
Alone,...
