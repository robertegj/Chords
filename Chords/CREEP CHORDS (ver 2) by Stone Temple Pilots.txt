Interpreted by D. Ramm (dramm9@excite.com)
 
I've seen other tab interpretations of this song and I'm a bit perturbed at what
seems to be some very tone deaf people out there. Not to say I am anywhere near
perfect in my interpretation but this seems to work just fine playing in a jam
session. (Note, Mr "other people are tone deaf"'s tab has now been corrected.)

*   Alternate the B7(Open E) and the B7 in the verse.
**  When playing Em in the bridge, you can alternate the chord by holding B string
(3rd Fret) and high E string (3rd fret) back and forth.
*** I am well aware the last line of the bridge has a variance on the C to D. I
found this the easiest way to play it however.
 
 
[Verse]
 
 Em           C    B7               Em
Forward yesterday makes me want to stay
 Em                 C     B7               Em
What they said was real, makes me want to steal
 Em           C           B7               Em
Living under house, yes I'm living I'm a mouse
 Em           C             B7               Em
All I got is time, got no meaning just a rhyme
 
 
[Bridge]
 
G                Am                      Em
Take time with a wounded hand, cause it likes to heal
G                Am                     Em
Take time with a wounded hand, guess I like to steal
G                Am                     C                  D
Take time with a wounded hand, cause it likes to heal, I like to steal***

Everybody run, Bobby's got a gun
Em                  C              B7               Em
Think you're kinda neat, then she tells me I'm a creep
Em                      C               B7             Em
Friends don't mean a thing, guess I'll leave it up to me

**** Vocal Note: The chorus is actually two vocal tracks overlaid on the album.
 
For the purpose of clarity I will call them (a) & (b)
 
Chorus (b) continues while Chorus (a) and the Guitar Riff breaks in immediately
after singing 'fades' in  Chorus (b)
 
If sung solo, you must truncate (cut-off) the last part of Chorus (b)..(i.e. 'to grey')
