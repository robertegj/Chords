What was a family,is now a shell
 
We're raising kids now,who raise themselves
 
Sex is a weapon,it's like a drug

It gets him right into that grave that he just dug

I'm chasing guys for fun

I know you wanna hit that, hit that
Em
Everybody's gettin with I say
C                   A
Consequences are a lot, but hey

Well it winds up broken up
 
Really such a shame
