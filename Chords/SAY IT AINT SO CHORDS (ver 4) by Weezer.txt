Sorry if anything is screwed up! I had to copy and paste the lyrics because I'm too lazy.
 
Intro: Am E F C x2
 
Am       E F C
Oh yeah.
 
Am       E F C
All right.
 
[Verse 1]
 
Am         E         F           C
Somebody's Heine' is crowdin' my icebox
Am         E           F         C
Somebody's cold one is givin' me chills
Am              E        F    C
Guess I'll just close my eyes
 
[Chorus]
   Am   E    F     C
Oh yeah,   alright
      Am   E    F   C
Feels good,  inside
 
[Verse 2]
 
Am          E      F            C
Flip on the tele', wrestle with Jimmy
Am           E        F         C
Something is bubbling behind my back
    Am        E        F     C
The bottle is ready to blow
 
[Chorus]
 
Am E  F            C
      Say it ain't so
Am      E         F        C
   Your drug is a heartbreaker
Am E  F            C
      Say it ain't so
Am      E       F      C
   My love is a lifetaker

[Verse 3]
 
Am         E          F       C
I can't confront you, I never could do
Am               E            F          C
That which might hurt you, so try and be cool
          Am      E        F                            C

Am   E           F     C
day (hey), so be cool

   Your drug is a heartbreaker
Am E  F            C
      Say it ain't so
Am      E       F      C
   My love is a lifetaker

   Dear Daddy,   I write you in spite of years of silence.
G                    G/F#           C                Bb
   You've cleaned up,   found Jesus, things are good or so I hear.
G             G/F#           C         Bb
   This bottle   of Steven's   awakens ancient feelings.
G              G/F#          C             Bb              Am   E
