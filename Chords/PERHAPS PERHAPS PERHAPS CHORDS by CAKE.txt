[Verse 1]
                    Cm
You won't admit you love me
    Fm
And so
         Cm
How am I ever
   Fm
To know
         Cm
You only tell me
   Ab       G        Cm
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps
 
[Verse 2]
                  Cm
A million times I ask you
    Fm
And then
          Cm
I ask you over
 Fm
Again
         Cm
You only answer
   Ab       G        Cm
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps
 
[Chorus]
                       G
If you can't make your mind up
                C
We'll never get started
                    G
And, I don't wanna' wind up
                     C
Being parted, broken hearted
 
[Verse 3]
                 Cm
So if you really love me
    Fm
Say yes
           Cm
But if you don't, dear,
   Fm
Confess
                 Cm
And please don't tell me
   Ab       G        Cm
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps
 
[Solo]

[Chorus]
                       G
If you can't make your mind up
                C
We'll never get started
                    G
And, I don't wanna' wind up
                     C
Being parted, broken hearted
 
[Outro]
                 Cm
So if you really love me
    Fm
Say yes
           Cm
But if you don't, dear,
   Fm
Confess
                 Cm
And please don't tell me
 
[Outro]
   Ab       G        Cm
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps
   Ab       G        Cm
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps
   Ab       G        Cm
Perhaps. Perhaps. Perhaps.
