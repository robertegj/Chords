Green Day - Time Of Your Life
-----------------------------
 
[Intro]
G   C   D  (x2)
 
[Verse]
G                       C                 D
Another turning point a fork stuck in the road
G                          C                  D
 Time grabs by the wrist directs you where to go 
Em           D            C                  G
 So make the best of this test and don't ask why
Em          D              C                 G
 It's not a question but a lesson learned in time 
 
[Chorus]
     Em             G             Em              G
It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right 
  Em               D            G
I hope you had the time of your life
 
G   C   D  (x2)
 
[Verse]
G                            C                    D
 So take the photographs and still frames in your mind
G                       C                    D
 Hang it on a shelf and good health and good time
Em          D            C            G
 Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial 
Em              D            C             G
 For what it's worth it was worth all the while   
 
[Chorus]
     Em             G             Em              G
It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right 
  Em               D            G
I hope you had the time of your life
 
[Break]
G   C   D  (x4)
 
Em   D   C   G   (x2)
 
[Chorus]
     Em             G             Em              G
It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right 
  Em               D            G
I hope you had the time of your life
 
G   C   D  (x2)
 
     Em             G             Em              G
It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right 
  Em               D            G
I hope you had the time of your life
 
G   C   D  (x2)    G
