[Verse 1]
C                      Em
 I can't focus on what needs to get done
Am                     F
 I'm on notice, hoping that you don't run
C                            Em
 You think I'm tepid but I'm misdiagnosed
Am                              F
'Cause I'm a stalker, I've seen all of your posts
 C
Ah
 
[Pre-Chorus]
             Em                     Am
And I'm just tryna play it cool now
                  F                 C
 But that's not what I wanna do now
            Em                     Am        F
And I'm not tryna be with you now, you now (Mhmm)
 
[Verse 2]
C                         Em
 You make it difficult to not overthink
Am                            F
 And when I'm with you I turn all shades of pink
C                            Em
 I wanna touch you but don't wanna be weird
Am                              F
 It's such a rush, I'm thinking wish you were here
 C
Ah
 
[Pre-Chorus]
             Em                     Am
And I'm just tryna play it cool now
                  F                 C
 But that's not what I wanna do now
            Em                     Am        F
And I'm not tryna be with you now, you now (Mhmm)
 
[Chorus]
                    C
But I could be your crush, like
                Em
Throw you for a rush, like
                Am                              F
Hoping you text me so I could tell ya I've been thinking 'bout your touch, like
C                           Em
Touch, touch, touch, touch, touch
                Am                          F
I could be your crush, crush, crush, crush, crush
 
[Post-Chorus]
                C                      Em
I've got a fascination with your presentation
               Am                                  F
Making me feel like you're on my island, you're my permanent vacation
C                           Em
Touch, touch, touch, touch, touch
                Am                          F
I could be your crush, crush, crush, crush, crush
N.C.

[Verse 3]
C                           Em
 I'll fill my calendar with stuff I can do
Am                          F
 Maybe if I'm busy it could keep me from you
C                             Em
 And I'm pretending you ain't been on my mind
Am                             F
 But I took an interest in the things that you like
 C
Ah
 
[Pre-Chorus]
             Em                     Am
And I'm just tryna play it cool now
                  F                 C
 But that's not what I wanna do now
            Em                     Am      F
And I'm not tryna be with you now, you now
 
[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Am                             F
 And yeah it's true that I'm a little bit intense, right
C                              G
 But can you blame me when you keep me on the fence, like
Am                         F                           C
 I've been waiting, hoping that you'd wanna text, like
         G
Text like
("That's what I was born to do")
Am                             F
 And yeah it's true that I'm a little bit intense, right
