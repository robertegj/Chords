If you want to play live version, transpose all chords except E5 two step up (+2 in Ultimate Guitar).
Note 1: Chords may not perfectly fit with lyrics.
Note 2: Originally it played in D Standard tuning with low D as first chord, so if you want to make it
perfectly sounding, you may want to drop your tuning to DADGBe and play D5(000xxx) instead of E5.
 
E5:      022xxx OR 02xxxx
F#5:     244xxx
B5:      x244xx
G5:      355xxx
Bb5:     x133xx
C5:      x355xx
A5:      x022xx
