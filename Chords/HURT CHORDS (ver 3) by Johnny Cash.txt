[Verse]
Am  C      D      Am      C      D       Am
I   hurt myself today, to see if I still feel
  C     D      Am        C    D           Am
I focus on the pain, the only thing thats real
    C      D       Am        C     D      Am
The needle tears a hole, the old familiar sting
       C       D    Am           C      D            G
Try to kill it all away, but I remember everything
 
[Chorus]
Am            F    C            G
What Have I become,  my sweetest friend
Am         F           C          G
Everyone I know, goes away in the end
    Am                F    C            G
And you could have it all, my empire of dirt
Am             F     G
I will let you down, I will make you hurt

[Verse]
Am C         D        Am       C      D     Am
I  wear this crown of thorns, upon my liars chair
C       D      Am        C    D     Am
Full of broken thoughts, I cannot repair
  C         D         Am        C       D      Am
Beneath the stains of time, the feeling   disappears
C       D       Am    C    D           G
You are someone else, I am still right here
 
[Chorus]
Am            F    C             G
What Have I become,  my sweetest friend
Am         F           C          G
Everyone I know, goes away in the end
    Am                F    C            G
And you could have it all, my empire of dirt
Am             F     G
I will let you down, I will make you hurt
 
[Outro]

   Am                 F         G
If I could start again, a million miles away
Am              F    G
I would keep myself, I would find a way.
