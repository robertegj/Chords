[Verse 1]
Dm                        Am
City's breaking down on a camel's back.
Gm                               Am
They just have to go 'cause they don't know wack
Dm                                 Am
So all you fill the streets, it's appealing to see
Gm                                        Am
You won't get out the county, 'cos you're damned and free
 
Dm                             Am
You've got a new horizon, it's ephemeral style.
Gm                          Am
A melancholy town where we never smile.
Dm                          Am
And all I wanna hear is the message beep.
Gm                                        Am
My dreams, they've got to kiss, because I don't get sleep, no..
 
 
[Chorus]
Dm                  Am
Windmill, windmill for the land.
Gm           Am
Turn forever hand in hand
Dm                Am
Take it all there on your stride
Gm             Am
It is sinking, falling down
Dm           Am
Love forever love is free
Gm                 Am
Let's turn forever you and me
Dm                 Am
Windmill, windmill for the land
Gm                 Am
Is everybody in?
 
 
(Timing is different here, chords same as first verse.)
 
[Verse 2]
                   Dm
Laughing gas these hazmats, fast cats,
Am
Lining them up-a like ass cracks,
Gm
Lay these ponies at the track
Am
It's my chocolate attack.
 
                   Dm
Shit, I'm stepping in the heart of this here
Am
Care bear bumping in the heart of this here
Gm
Watch me as I gravitate
Am
Hahahahahahaa.
 
                   Dm
Yo, we gonna go ghost town, this motown,
Am
With yo sound, you're in the place
Gm
You gonna bite the dust, can't fight with us
Am
With yo sound you kill the INC.
 
                   Dm
So don't stop, get it, get it
Am
Until you're Jet Ahead.
Gm
Yo, watch the way I navigate
Am
Hahahahahhaa.
 
 
[Chorus]
Dm                  Am
Windmill, windmill for the land.
Gm           Am
Turn forever hand in hand
Dm                Am
Take it all there on your stride
Gm             Am
It is sinking, falling down
Dm           Am
Love forever love is free
Gm                 Am
Let's turn forever you and me
Dm                 Am
Windmill, windmill for the land
Gm                 Am
Is everybody in?
 
 
[Outro]
Dm
Don't stop, get it, get it
Am
We are your captains in it
Gm
Steady, watch me navigate,
Am
Ahahahahahhaa.
 
Dm
Don't stop, get it, get it
