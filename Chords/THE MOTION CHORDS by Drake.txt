No Capo
 
[Intro]
Em                   C
It's not me and you, it's not me it's you
Am                               B7
You're reckless and you know it, they don't love you like I do
Em                           C                             Am
Say you're moving on, well, I guess that's just the motion
B7
I guess that's just the motion
Em C Am B7
 
[Verse 1]
Em                           C
I don't have a fuck to give, I've been moving state to state
Am                         B7
In my leather and my Timbs like it's 1998
Em                      C
And my dog Chubby Chub, that's my nigga from the way
Am                           B7
On the east side of the city that's where everybody stay
Em                         C
Seem like everybody calling cause they want me on their song
Am                             B7
It's like every time I touch it I could never do no wrong
Em                                    C                         Am
When they need a favor from your man, they don't leave you alone
B7                                Em C
But I guess that's just the motion
 
[Hook]
Am
Then that phone doesn't ring
          B7                         Em    C
When they got everything, that's the motion
Am     B7                            Em C Am B7
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
 
[Verse 2]
(No Chords)
Yeah, looking back on it at least my pride is intact
Am                                                B7
Cause we said no strings attached and I still got tied up in that
Em                                 C
Everything that I write is either for her or about her
Am                                      B7
So I'm with her even when I'm here without her and she know it
Em                             C
The girl that I wanna save is like a danger to my health
Am                                 B7
Try being with somebody that wanna be somebody else
Em                                       C
I always thought she was perfect when she was being herself
Am                              B7                             Em C
Don't even know how to help, but I guess that's just the motion
 
[Hook]
Am
She'll probably come around
B7                                      Em C
Soon as I settle down, that's the motion
Am     B7
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
