[Intro]
D   F#   x4
 
[Verse 1]
E               B
Sometimes I feel like
C#m      G#m      A
I don't have a partner
E               B
Sometimes I feel like
C#m         A
My only friend
E              B
Is the city I live in
C#m     G#m     A
The city of angels?
E             B
Lonely as I am
C#m      A    Emaj7
Together we cry 
 
[Verse 2]
E           B
I drive on her streets 'cause
C#m         G#m       A
She's my companion
E              B
I walk through her hills 'cause
C#m           A
She knows who I am
E           B
She sees my good deeds and
C#m         G#m       A
She kisses me windy
E              B
I never worry,
C#m      A      Emaj7
Now that is a lie
 
[Chorus]
F#m           E
I don't ever want to feel
B/F#          F#m
Like I did that day
                        E
Take me to the place I love
B/F#          F#m
Take me all the way
 
F#m           E
I don't ever want to feel
B/F#          F#m
Like I did that day
                        E
Take me to the place I love
B/F#          F#m
Take me all the way

[Verse 3]
E           B
It's hard to believe that
C#m         G#m       A
There's nobody out there
E               B
It's hard to believe that
C#m      A
I'm all alone
E            B
At least I have her love
C#m      G#m       A
The city, she loves me
E         B
Lonely as I am
C#m      A    Emaj7
Together we cry
 
[Chorus]
F#m               E
I don't ever want to feel
B/F#          F#m
Like I did that day
                        E
Take me to the place I love
B/F#          F#m
Take me all the way
 
F#m               E
I don't ever want to feel
B/F#          F#m
Like I did that day
                        E
Take me to the place I love
B/F#          F#m
Take me all the way
