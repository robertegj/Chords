[Verse 1: Daron Malakian]
Em
   I'll wait here, you're crazy
                                      G
Those vicious streets are filled with strays
               Bm
You should have never gone to Hollywood
Em
   They find you, two time you
                                 G
Say you're the best they've ever seen
               Bm                         Em
You should have never trusted Hollywood
 
 
[Verse 2: Daron Malakian]
Em
   I wrote you and told you
                              G
You were the biggest fish out here
               Bm
You should have never gone to Hollywood
Em
   They take you and make you
                                 G
They looked at you in disgusting ways
               Bm
You should have never trusted Hollywood

G                        D                      Em
   I was standing on the wall, feeling ten feet tall
                        Bm            C
All you maggots smoking fags on Santa Monica Boulevard
G                   D                    Em
   This is my front page, this is my new age
                         Bm
All you bitches put your hands in the air
    C                                   G D
And wave them like you just don't care
Em                          Bm                C                 G D
    All you maggots smoking fags out there on Sunset Boulevard
Em                           Bm
    All you bitches put your hands in the air
    C
And wave them like you just don't care
