Bm
Hello,
                 A
is there anybody in there? 
     G              Em
Just nod if you can hear me;
         Bm
is there anyone home? 
 
 
Come on, now,
              A
I hear you're feeling down.
      G               Em
Well, I can ease your pain;
        Bm
get you on your feet again.
 
Relax,
                 A
I need some information first.
G              Em
Just the basic facts:
        Bm
can you show me where it hurts? 
 
D                           A
There is no pain, you are receding.
D                              A
A distant ships smoke on the horizon.
C                              G
You are only coming through in waves.
     C                                      G
Your lips move but I can't hear what you re saying.
     D                     A
When I was a child I had a fever.
   D                           A
My hands felt just like two balloons.
C                            G
Now I got that feeling once again;
                     C
I can't explain, you would not understand.
                  G
This is not how I am.
A C       G                 D
I  have become, comfortably numb.
 
D A D A C G C G
 
A C       G                 D
I  have become, comfortably numb.
 
Bm
Ok, (ok)
              A
just a little pinprick. 
                      G      Em
There'll be no more --aaaaaahhhhh!
            Bm
But you may feel a little sick.
 
 
Can you stand up?
                  A
I do believe it's working good.
                 G              Em
That'll keep you going for the show.
             Bm
Come on it's time to go.
 
D                           A
There is no pain, you are receding.
D                               A
A distant ship's smoke on the horizon.
C                              G
You are only coming through in waves.
     C                                      G
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying.
     D                        A
When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse,
D                       A
out of the corner of my eye.
  C                         G
I turned to look but it was gone.
                       C
I cannot put my finger on it now.
                        G
The child is grown, the dream is gone.
A C       G                 D
I  have become, comfortably numb.
