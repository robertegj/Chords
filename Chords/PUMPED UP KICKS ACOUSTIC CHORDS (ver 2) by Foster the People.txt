Robert's got a quick hand
      D                             A7
He'll look around the room he won't tell you his plan
Em               D/F# G
Got a rolled cigarette
D                             A7
Hangin' out his mouth, he's a cowboy kid
      Em                  D/F# G
Yeah, found a six-shooter gun
       D                         A7
In his dads closet hidden with a box of fun things
Em                D/F# G
I don't even know what
         D                         A7
But he's comin' for you, yeah he's comin for you, hey
 
 
Em                 D/F#     G
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
             D
You'd better run, better run
A7
Outrun my gun
Em                 D/F#     G
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
             D
You'd better run, better run

Faster than my bullet

Daddy works a long day
         D                      A7
He'll be coming home late, he's coming home late
         Em               D/F# G
And he's bringing me a surprise
     D                                A7
Cos' dinner's in the kitchen and it's packed in ice
     Em                D/F# G
I've waited for a long time
    D                          A7
The slight of my hand is now a quick pull trigger
  Em                 D/F# G
I reason with my cigarette
             D                            A7
And say your hair's on fire you must have lost your wits, yeah
