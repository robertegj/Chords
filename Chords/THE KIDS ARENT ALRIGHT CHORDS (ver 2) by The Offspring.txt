[Verse]
Am                                                 F
When we were young the future was so bright (Woah-oh!)
                                         C
The old neighborhood was so alive (Woah-oh!)
                                               G
And every kid on the whole damn street (Woah-oh!)
 
Was gonna make it big and not be beat
 
Am                                              F
Now the neighborhood's cracked and torn (Woah-oh!)
                                                       C
The kids are grown up but their lives are worn (Woah-oh!)
                         G
How can one little street
 
Swallow so many lives
 
[Chorus]
        Am
Chances thrown
          F
Nothing's free
        C                G
Longing for what used to be
           Am
Still it's hard
        F
Hard to see
        C                G
Fragile lives, shattered dreams
 
[Verse]
Am                                            F
Jamie had a chance, well she really did (Woah-oh!
                                                          C
Instead she dropped out and had a couple of kids (Woah-oh!)
                                              G
Mark still lives at home cause he's got no job
 
Just plays guitar and smokes a lot of pot
Am                            F
Jay committed suicide (Woah-oh!)
                              C
Brandon OD'd and died (Woah-oh!)
 
What the hell is going on
G
cruelest dream, reality
 
[Chorus]
        Am
Chances thrown
          F
Nothing's free
        C                G
Longing for what used to be
           Am
Still it's hard
        F
Hard to see
        C                G
Fragile lives, shattered dreams
        Am
Chances thrown
          F
Nothing's free
        C                G
Longing for what used to be
           Am
Still it's hard
        F
Hard to see
        C                G
Fragile lives, shattered dreams
