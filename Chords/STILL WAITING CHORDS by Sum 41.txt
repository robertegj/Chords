So am I still waiting

[Chorus 1]
 
Em          G
Drop dead a bullet to my head
Em             G
Your words are like a gun in hand
Em               G
You can't change the state of the nation
Em           D
We just need some motivation
Em           G
Since I have seen no conviction
Em            G
Just lies and more contradiction
Em         G
So tell me what would you say
Em          D
I'd say its up, to me
 
 
[Instrumental]
 
Em      C       G       D
 
 
[Chorus 2]
 
Em            G
Ignorance and Understanding
Em                      G
We're the first ones to jump in line
Em              G
Out of step for what we believe in
Em             D
But whos left? To start the pleading
Em           G
How far will we take this
Em               G
It's not hard to see through the thickness
Em         G
So tell me what would you say
Em          D
I'd say its up, to me
 
 
[Chorus 3]
 
Em   C     G       D
This can't last forever
Em   C     G           D
Time won't make things better
Em     G  D Em
I feel so alone
Em    G    D Em
Can't help myself
Em  G  D   Em
And no one knows
Em      G    D
If this is worthless
Em        C        G        D
Tell me:                         so
 
 
[Instrumental]
 
Em      C       G       D (x2)
 
 
[Outro]
 
Em        C
What have we done
G                   D
We're in a war that can't be won
Em         C
This can't be real
G                 D
I don't know what to feel
 
 
[Chorus] (x2)
