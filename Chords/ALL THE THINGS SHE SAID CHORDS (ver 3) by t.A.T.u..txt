I’m in serious shit, have I totally lost

If I’m asking for help it’s only because

Being with you has opened my eyes
Bm
Could I ever believe such a perfect surprise?
 
Em
I keep asking myself, wondering how
Dsus2
I keep closing my eyes but I can’t block you out
G6
Want to fly to a place where it’s just you and me

Nobody else so we can be free (Nobody else so we can be free)

Em
And I'm all mixed up, feeling cornered and rushed
Dsus2
They say it's my fault but I want her so much
G6
Want to fly her away where the sun and rain
Bm
Come in over my face, wash away all the shame
 
Em
When they stop and stare don't worry me
Dsus2
Cause I'm feeling for her what she's feeling for me
G6
I can try to pretend, I can try to forget
Bm
But it's driving me mad, going out of my headddd
