[Verse 1]
Dm7          Em7
    polaroid of you dancing in my room
Dm7              Em7
    i want to remember, i think it was about noon
Dm7                       Em7
   it's getting harder to understand, to understand
Dm7                          Em7
   how you felt in my hands, in my hands
 
[Chorus]
Dm7           Cmaj7            Em7              Dm7
i could be a pretty girl, i'll wear a skirt for you
Dm7           Cmaj7            Em7                 Dm7
i could be a pretty girl, shut up when you want me to
Dm7           Cmaj7              Em7           Dm7
i could be a pretty girl, won't ever make you blue
Dm7           Cmaj7            Em7             Dm7
i could be a pretty girl, i'll lose myself in you
 
[Verse 2]
Dm7              Em7           Dm7
i was so blinded by you, now i cry
                        Em7
just thinking 'bout the fool that i was
Em7          Dm7
I WAS SUCH A FOOL!
    Dm7                Em7
i'm alone now but it's better for me
  Dm7               Em7        Fmaj7
i don't need all your negativity
 
[Chorus]
Dm7           Cmaj7            Em7              Dm7
i could be a pretty girl, i'll wear a skirt for you
Dm7           Cmaj7            Em7                 Dm7
i could be a pretty girl, shut up when you want me to
Dm7           Cmaj7              Em7          Dm7
i could be a pretty girl, won't ever make you blue
Dm7           Cmaj7            Em7            Dm7
i could be a pretty girl, i'll lose myself in you
