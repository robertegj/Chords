[Verse 1]
 
A                            F#m7
Her green plastic watering can
          E          E6        D5
For her fake chinese rubber plant
              A     D5
In the fake plastic earth
A                               F#m7
That she bought from a rubber man
           E        E6      D5
In a town full of rubber plans
       A      D5
To get rid of itself
 
 
[Chorus]
 
             Bm7
It wears her out..
             A        Asus
It wears her out..
             Bm7
It wears her out..
             A        Asus
It wears her out
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
A                         F#m7
She lives with a broken man
        E    E6       D5
A cracked polystyrene man 
          A           D5
Who just crumbles and burns
A                   F#m7
He used to do surgery
        E       E6    D5
For girls in the eighties
            A      D5
But gravity always wins
 
 
[Chorus]
 
            Bm7
It wears him out..
             A        Asus
It wears him out..
             Bm7
It wears him out..
             A        Asus
It weaaaaaaarrrs
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
A                            F#m7
She looks like the real thing
         E          E6      D5
She tastes like the real thing
          A     D5
My fake plastic love
A                         F#m7
But I can't help the feeling
          E         E6        D5
I could blow through the ceiling
           A        D5
If I just turn and run
 
 
[Chorus]
 
            Bm7
It wears me out..
            A        Asus
It wears me out..
            Bm7
It wears me out..
            A        Asus
It wears me out
 
 
[Outro]
 
               Bm7
And if I could be who you wanted
           A
If I could be who you wanted
       Bm7
All the time..
       A
All the time..
