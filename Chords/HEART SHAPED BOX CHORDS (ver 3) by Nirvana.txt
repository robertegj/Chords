[Verse]
 
G#m  E       C#            G#m  E    C# C#7
 She eyes me like a Pisces when I am weak,
G#m        E        C#                     G#m E   C# C#7
 I've been locked inside your heart shaped box for weeks.
G#m        E       C#             G#m E   C# C#7
 I've been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap,
G#m     E       C#              G#m  E        C# C#7
 I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black...
 
 
[Chorus]
 
  G#m   E
    Hey, wait,
  C#
    I got a new complaint,
  G#m  E       C#
    Forever in debt to your priceless advice,
  G#m   E
    Hey, wait,

G#m  E       C#            G#m  E    C# C#7
Meat-eating orchids forgive no one just yet.
G#m        E        C#                     G#m E   C# C#7
Cut myself on angel hair and baby's breath.
G#m        E       C#             G#m E   C# C#7
Broken hymen of your highness, I'm left black,
G#m     E       C#              G#m  E        C# C#7
Throw down your umbilical noose so I can climb right back...
 
 
[Chorus]

  G#m  E       C#

    Forever in debt to your priceless advice,

    Hey, wait,
