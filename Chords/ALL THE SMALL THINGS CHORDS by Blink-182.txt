True care, truth brings

Your ride best trip

Watching, waiting

Commiserating

Turn the lights off, carry me home

She left me roses by the stairs
   G                         C
Surprises let me know she cares

Keep your head still, I'll be your thrill
                  F                 C
The night will go on, my little windmill
                            G
Say it ain't so, I will not go
                F             C
Turn the lights off, carry me home
                                   G
Keep your head still, I'll be your thrill
                  F
The night will go on, the night will go on
              C
My little windmill...
