Hash Pipe- Weezer
 
A/ B C (Single notes)
I can’t help my feelings
A/ B C
I’ll go out of my mind
A/ B C
These players come to get me
A/ B C
’Cause they’d like my behind
A/ B C
I can’t love my business
A/ B C
If I can’t get a trick
A/ B C
Down on Santa Monica
A/ B C
Where tricks are for kicks
 
D (5 Times)
Oh, come on and kick me
A/ B C  (4 times)
D                      F
Oh, come on and kick me
                         E
(Oh.) Come on and kick me
                              D
(Oh.) You’ve got your problems
                          C
(Oh.) I’ve got my ass wipe
                       B
You got your big cheese
(No chord)
I got my hash pipe
 
A/ B  C (6 times)
 
A/ B  C (same for each line)
I can’t help my boogies
They get out of control
I know that you don’t care
But I want you to know
The knee-stocking flavor
Is a favorite treat
Of men that don’t bother
With the taste of a teat
 
D (5 Times)
Oh, come on and kick me
A/ B C  (4 times)
D                      F

(Oh.) Come on and kick me
                              D
(Oh.) You’ve got your problems
                          C
(Oh.) I’ve got my ass wipe
                       B
You got your big cheese
(No chord)          G
I got my hash pipe

Chorded by Kenny Perry, not sure if all the lyrics are correct, hard to tell what
he's saying. Play along with the song you'll get it.
