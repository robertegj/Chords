[Intro]
Bm G A F# x4 Play barre chords
I think I, I think I finally found a way to forgive myself
From mistakes I made in my past
I think that's the first step, right?
You agree?
 
[Verse]
Bm          G
I've dug two graves for us, my dear
A                       F#
Can't pretend that I was perfect, leaving you in fear
Bm             G
Oh man, what a  world, the things I hear
A                      F#
If I could act on my revenge, then oh, would I?
Bm             G
Some kill, some steal, some break your heart
A                            F#
And you thought that I would let it go, and let you walk
Bm                       G
Well, broken hearts break bones, so break up fast
A                       F#
And I don't wanna let it go so in my grave I'll rot
Bm          G
I've dug two graves for us, my dear
