Inside Out by Eve 6
 
[Chorus]
A                  E
I would swallow my pride
                     B
I would choke on the rinds
                                              A
But the lack thereof would leave me empty inside
A                 E                       F#
I would swallow my doubt turn it inside out
 
(find nothing but faith in nothing)
               E                B
Want to put my tender heart in a blender
           F#
Watch it spin around to a beautiful oblivion
E              B        F#
Rendezvous then I'm through with you
 
[Verse]
B           F#                   A                    G
I burn burn like a wicker cabinet chalk white and oh so frail
B       F#        E
I see our time had gotten stale
B                  F#
The tick tock of the clock is painful
A       G
All sane and logical
B         F#            E
I want to tear it off the wall
B                 F#
I hear words and clips and phrases
A               G
I think sick like ginger ale
B         F#            G
My stomach turns and I exhale
 
[Chorus]
A                  E
I would swallow my pride
                     B
I would choke on the rinds
                                              A
But the lack thereof would leave me empty inside
A                 E                       F#
I would swallow my doubt turn it inside out
 
(find nothing but faith in nothing)
               E                B
Want to put my tender heart in a blender
           F#
Watch it spin around to a beautiful oblivion
E              B        F#
Rendezvous then I'm through with you
 
[Verse]
B         F#
So cal is where my mind states
A                        G
but it's not my state of mind
B           F#          E
I'm not as ugly sad as you
B       F#
Or am I origami
A             G
Folded up and just pretend
B               F#              G
demented as the motives in your head
 
[Chorus]
A                  E
I would swallow my pride
                     B
I would choke on the rinds
                                              A
But the lack thereof would leave me empty inside
A                 E                       F#
I would swallow my doubt turn it inside out
 
(find nothing but faith in nothing)
               E                B
Want to put my tender heart in a blender
           F#
Watch it spin around to a beautiful oblivion
E              B        F#
Rendezvous then I'm through with you
 
B/F#  E  A  E  Staccato
 
B/F#    E              A                   E
I alone am the one you don't know you need take heed feed your ego
B/F#          E                     A                        E
Make me blind when your eyes close, sink when you get close, tie me to the
 
Bed post
B/F#    E              A                   E
I alone am the one you don't know you need you don't know you need me.
B/F#    E                           A  (pause)        E
make me Blind when your eyes close, tie me to the bed post
 
[Chorus]
B                  E
I would swallow my pride
                     A
I would choke on the rinds
                       E                       B
But the lack thereof would leave me empty inside
B                E                       A
I would swallow my doubt turn it inside out 
             E
Find nothing but faith in nothing
B                     E
Want to put my tender heart in a blender
A                         E
Watch it spin around to a beautiful oblivion
B          E        A            E                 B
Rendezvous then I'm through, now I'm through with you

Through with you (x3)
 
B  E  A  F#
 
E          B        F#
