[Verse 1]
Em               Am
I feel like Atlas, I got my back stretched
C                   B
You wanna grab this, you don't understand this
Em                  Am
I keep it oppressed, work on my realness
C                   B
Reading my manifest, I'll address your request
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Em                   Am
I've been waking up drenched in sweat
C                      B
All my dreams, full of my regret (my regret)
Em                     Am
I keep hearing what my mother said
C                      B
Eyes are open, all I see is red
 
 
[Chorus]
Em                Am
I met you in California
     C                         B
You told me you loved him in Georgia
       Em                          Am
Your heart's in the ground, frozen over
     C                       B
My heart's in the sky, supernova
Em                Am
I met you in California
     C                         B
You told me you loved him in Georgia
       Em                          Am
Your heart's in the ground, frozen over
     C                       B
My heart's in the sky, supernova
 
 
[Verse 2]
Em                     Am
Look overhead at the stars and the ocean
C                 B
Foggy emotions, moments, erosion
Em                     Am
This supernova could cause a comotion
C                                C
My minds of the notion, you'll still be my motive
Em                       Am
I've been, I've been so fucked in my head
 C                               B
I've been going through phases, I'm just going through phases
Em                             Am
Don't know what this craze is
                                         C
When's the last time someone said shit? (ohhh)
                         B
Walking through your mazes
 
When's the last time someone meant it? (ohhh)
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Em                   Am
I've been waking up drenched in sweat
C                      B
All my dreams, full of my regret (my regret)
Em                     Am
I keep hearing what my mother said
C                      B
Eyes are open, all I see is red
 
 
[Chorus]
Em                Am
I met you in California
     C                         B
You told me you loved him in Georgia
       Em                          Am
Your heart's in the ground, frozen over
     C                       B
My heart's in the sky, supernova
Em                Am
I met you in California
     C                         B
You told me you loved him in Georgia
       Em                          Am
Your heart's in the ground, frozen over
     C                       B
My heart's in the sky, supernova
 
 
[Flute Solo]
 
 
[Chorus]
Em                Am
I met you in California
     C                         B
You told me you loved him in Georgia
       Em                          Am
Your heart's in the ground, frozen over
     C                       B
My heart's in the sky, supernova
