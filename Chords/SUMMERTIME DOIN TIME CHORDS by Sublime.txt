This is the final song on Sublime's third album, and it was their commercial breakthrough. It became a hit
shortly after Sublime lead singer Brad Nowell died of a drug overdose.
 
"Doin' Time" was originally in the lyrics but was replaced by "Summertime" at the last minute.
 
On this track, Brad Nowell compares life with his cheating girlfriend to being locked down in prison -
somewhat ironic since in real life, these roles were usually reversed. "He screwed around on the road,"
Sublime bass player Eric Wilson told us about Nowell.
 
This contains a sample from the Beastie Boys' "Slow and Low" from their 1986 album License to Ill. The line
is, "And when we do it like this, in the place to be."
