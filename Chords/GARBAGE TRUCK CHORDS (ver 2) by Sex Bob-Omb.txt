[Verse]
 
E             D      G   B
I'll take you for a ride
E       D      G    B
On my garbage truck
B     A
Oh no
 
 
 
E             D      G   B
I'll take you to the dump
E    D      G    B
'Cuz you're my queen
A        C
Take you uptown
A                  C
I'll show you the sights
 C           D
You know you wanna ride
 
E       D      G    B
 
E       D      G    B
On my garbage truck
 
E D G       B
...  truck truck truck
 
A                 C
We'll pass nations by
A                      C        D
Drive right through the needle's eye, Oh my!
 
E     D      G     B

A            C
I got a stereo
A                       C
You just gotta turn the knob
 C  D            E    D      G
And baby we'll go
B                E     D
As far as we can
G           B                E        D
I'll be your garbage man
G           B                E        D
I'll take out your junk
G           B
And crush it down
 
A            C
Jesus in the rear view
A                   C      D
And the highway patrol is up ahead
E D G     B             E  D  G
 
... in my garbage truck, truck
 
 G           B             E          D
I'll never throw you away
G            B             E          D
when you're old and grey
G            B             E          D      G
we'll just fold it away...
