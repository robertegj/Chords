Sheep Go to Heaven-Cake
This is a bare-bones chord sheet for this song.
There are walkdowns & other embellishments they do,that I don't know yet but this should get you started.
Starts in A
 
[Verse 1]
A A
I?m not feeling alright today
A A
I?m not feeling that great 
A A
I?m not catching on fire today
D                   A
love has started to fade
 
A A
I?m not going to smile today
A A
I?m not gonna laugh
A A
you're out living it up today
D                A
I?ve got dues to pay
 
[Pre-Chorus]
         A            D           A      D
And the grave-digger puts on the forceps
     A           D            A    D
The stone mason does all the work
     E         E7         A      A7
The barber can give you a haircut 
     D                             E
The carpenter can take you out to lunch
 
A               D          A        D
I just want to play on my pan-pipes
A               D             A   D
I just want to drink me some wine
E                 E7             A     A7
as soon as you're born you start dying
        D                         E
so you might as well have a good time
 
[Chorus]
D            A       E           A
Sheep go to heaven  Goats go to hell
D            A       E            A
Sheep go to heaven  Goats? go to hell
 
[Verse 2]
A A
I don't wanna go to sunset strip
A A
I don't wanna feel the emptiness
A A
bold marquees with stupid band names
D                           A
I don't wanna go to sunset strip
 
A A
I don't wanna go to sunset strip
A A
I don't wanna feel the emptiness
A A
Bold marquees with stupid band names
D                           A
I don't wanna go to sunset strip
 
         A            D           A      D
And the grave-digger puts on the forceps
     A           D            A    D
The stone mason does all the work
     E         E7         A      A7
