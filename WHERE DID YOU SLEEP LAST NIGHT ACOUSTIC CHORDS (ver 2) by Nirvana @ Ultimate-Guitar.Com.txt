[Verse 1]
 
E         Em            A       G
My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
        B                        Em
Tell me where did you sleep last night
 
 
[Chorus]
 
E       Em
In the pines, in the pines
          A              G
Where the sun don't ever shine
        B                  Em
I would shiver the whole night through
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
E        Em              A        G

I'm going where the cold wind blows
 
 
[Chorus]
 
E             Em
In the pines, in the pines
          A              G
Where the sun don't ever shine

I would shiver the whole night through
 
 
[Bridge]
 
E                Em       A            G
Her husband, was a hard working man
     B                 Em
Just about a mile from here
E            Em          A       G
His head was found in a driving wheel
B                      Em
But his body never was found

I would shiver the whole night through
