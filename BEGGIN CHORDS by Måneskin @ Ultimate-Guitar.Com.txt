[Verse 1]
Bm           G
  Ridin' high, when I was king
C#m7                   F#7
  I played it hard and fast, 'cause I had everything
Bm             G
  I walked away, you want me then
C#m7                F#7
  But easy come and easy go and it would end
 
    Bm
So, any time I need ya, let me go
      G
Yeah, any time I feed you, get me? No
C#m7
Any time I see you, let me know
      F#7
But I planted that seed, just let me grow
    Bm
I'm on my knees while I'm beggin'
       G                    C#m7
'Cause I don't wanna lose you
    F#7         Bm
Hey yeah, ratatata
 
 
[Chorus]
(Bm)       G           C#m7
I'm beggin', beggin' you
                    F#7
And put your loving hand out, baby
Bm           G           C#m7
  I'm beggin', beggin' you
                    F#7
And put your loving hand out, darlin'
 
 
[Verse 2]
N.C.          G
I need you to understand
C#m7              F#7
 Tried so hard to be your man
Bm                    G
  The kind of man you want in the end
     C#m7                F#7
Only then can I begin to live again
 
Bm              G
  An empty shell, I used to be
C#m7               F#7
  The shadow of my life was hangin' over me
Bm            G
  A broken man, but I don't know
C#m7                   F#7
  Won't even stand the devil's dance to win my soul
 
 
[Verse 3]
        Bm
What we doin'? What we chasin'?
        G
Why the bottom? Why the basement?
       C#m7
Why we got good shit, don't embrace it?
        F#7
Why the feel for the need to replace me?
           Bm
You on the wrong way track from the good
                  G
I want to paint a picture tellin' where we could be at
       C#m7
Like a heart in the best way should
                 F#7
You can give it away, ya had it and you took the bait
     Bm
But I keep walkin' on
              G
Keep rockin' dawns
 
Keep walking forward
                 C#m7
Now the court is yours
 
Keep browsin' halls
                     F#7
'Cause I don't wanna live in a broken home
 
Girl, I'm beggin'
 
 
[Chorus]
Bm N.C.

So put your loving hand out, baby
Bm           G           C#m7
  I'm beggin', beggin' you

[Verse 4]
N.C.
I'm fightin' hard
   G
To hold my own
C#m7                  F#7
   Just can't make it all alone
Bm
   I'm holdin' on
  G
I can't fall back
    C#m7                F#7
I'm just a con about to fade to black
 
 
[Chorus]
Bm           G           C#m7
  I'm beggin', beggin' you
               F#7
