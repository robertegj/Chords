[Verse ]
                  Db F5   Bb5
I've been talking so much shit
Gb           Db  F5 Bb5
On myself in my own head
  Gb           Bb5        Eb5 Db  Gb5
I know it does no good but I still do
 
Db F Bbm
 
Gb       Db  F5  Bbm
And if I get one chance
Gb                 Db
To end my life for real
   F    Bbm
I won't wince
       Gb          Bb5             Ebm        Gb       Db
'Cause maybe if I died right now I would be a great man
 
F Bbm
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Bbm        Gb
I've been thinking a lot
N.C
I've been thinking a lot
I've been thinking a lot
I've been thinking a lot
 
[Chorus]
                     Db  F
I've been thinking a lot
Bbm       Gb             Db  F
About how my friends are gone
Bbm      Gb         Bb
And it's not their fault that I'm never around
Gb                          Db  F Bb
Those things are all that I want
    Gb            Db F
I'm all that I've got
Bb            Gb            Db F Bb
Right now I'm all that I've got
      Gb             Bb5             Bbm      Gb
You'd think from the past that I've learned a lot
Gb              Db
But I'm so damn lost
 
F Bb Gb
 
[Bridge]
Gb      Bbm                          Gb
And the way that I work is just like everyone else
           Db                         C
But I don't wanna think that so I destroy my health
           Gb
I am invincible!
           A
I am invincible!

I'm a sad little man
I'm a sad little man
I'm a sad little man
 
[Chorus 2]
                 Db F Bb
I'm a sad fuckin man
              Gb      Db F Bbm
I should just flip my van
Gb        Bb                          Gb
So I can die alone with the things I love
Gb               Db  F
My guitar and my amp
Bb                     Db  F
That's why I play this song
Bbm          Gb           Db  F Bb5
In hopes someone sings along
Gb          Bb
So you can share my pain
        Gb
Let's connect our brains
Db         F      Bb5
And be two broken halves
Gb        Db
Let's be broken
 
[Solo]
F Bbm Gb Db x2
F Bbm Bb Db
F Bbm Gb Db(let ring)
 
[Outro]

I'm just a sad little man
I'm just a sad little man
I'm just a sad little man
