Nirvana - Dumb Acoustic
 
 
[Verse 1]
Em   A         G
I'm not like them
C              Em
But I can pretend
A           G
The sun is gone
    C          Em
But I have a light
A            G
The day is done
     C          Em
But I'm having fun
A             G
I think I'm dumb
C             E5
Or maybe just happy
 
 
[Chorus]
G                E5
  Think I'm just happy
G                E5
  Think I'm just happy
G                E5     G
  Think I'm just happy
 
 
[Verse 2]
Em   A             G
     My heart is broke
    C              Em
But I have some glue
A          G
Help me inhale
C                 Em
And mend it with you
A               G
We'll float around
C                  Em
And hang out on clouds
A              G
Then we'll come down
C              E5
And have a hangover
 
 
[Chorus]
G            E5
  Have a hangover
G            E5
  Have a hangover
G            E5    G
  Have a hangover
 
 
[Bridge]
B          C
Skin the sun
 
Fall asleep
B
Wish away
C
The soul is cheap
B
Lesson learned
C
Wish me luck
B
Soothe the burn
C
Wake me up
 
 
[Verse 3]
Em    A         G
I'm not like them
C              Em
But I can pretend
A           G
The sun is gone
    C          Em
But I have a light
A            G
The day is done
     C          Em
But I'm having fun
A             G
I think I'm dumb
C             E5
Or maybe just happy
 
 
[Chorus]
G                E5
  Think I'm just happy
G                E5
  Think I'm just happy
G                E5     G
  Think I'm just happy
 
 
[Outro]
Em   A            G
     I think I'm dumb
C            Em
I think I'm dumb
A            G
I think I'm dumb
C            Em
I think I'm dumb
A            G
I think I'm dumb
C            Em
I think I'm dumb
A            G
I think I'm dumb
C            Em
I think I'm dumb
A            G
I think I'm dumb
C            Em
I think I'm dumb
A            G
I think I'm dumb
C            Em
I think I'm dumb
