[Verse 1]
B                 C
Teacher says that I've been naughty
G               B
I must learn to concentrate
B                  C
But the girls they pull my hair
    G               B
And with the boys I can't relate
B              C
Daddy says I'm good for nothing
G              B
Mama says that it's from him
B            C
Manic sister thinks I'm cracking
G                 B
Brother says it's in my genes
 
 
[Chorus]
Em          C
  Don't you want to?
A          D              Em
 Don't you want to be the one?
          C
Don't you want to?
A                   D
Bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang
Em          C
  Don't you want to?
A           D                Em
  Don't you want to hold the gun?
          C
Don't you want to?
A                   D
Bang bang bang bang bang bang bang
 
 
[Verse 2]
B            C
So we put on our eyeliner
G            B
And a bit of glitter dust
B                C
Life at night is always finer
G                B
Neon streets are full of lust
B                C
Teenage kids and Soho Dolls
     G                B
They make you want to cry
B            C
Like my superstar they fall
G              B
Some will be alright
 
 
[Chorus]
Em          C
  Don't you want to?
A          D              Em
 Don't you want to be the one?
          C
Don't you want to?
A                   D
Bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang
Em          C
  Don't you want to?
A           D                Em
  Don't you want to hold the gun?
          C
Don't you want to?
A                   D
Bang bang bang bang bang bang bang

[Verse 3]
B                C
Sunlight falls onto his eyes
    G                B
But he don't stir or turn
B               C
Messages on the answerphone
    G              B
But none will be returned
B               C
Monday morning, lousy morning
G             B
What a day to see
B              C
In the evening I will hear it
G        B
On the BBC
 
 
[Chorus]
Em          C
  Don't you want to?
A          D              Em
 Don't you want to be the one?
          C
Don't you want to?
A                   D
Bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang
Em          C
  Don't you want to?
A           D                Em
  Don't you want to hold the gun?
          C
Don't you want to?
A                   D
Bang bang bang bang bang bang bang
 
 
Em          C
  Don't you want to?
A           D              Em
 Don't you want to be the one?
          C
Don't you want to?
A                   D
Bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang
Em          C
  Don't you want to?
A           D                Em
  Don't you want to hold the gun?
          C
Don't you want to?
A                   D
Bang bang bang bang bang bang bang
