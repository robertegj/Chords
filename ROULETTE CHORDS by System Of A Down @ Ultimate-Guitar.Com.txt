[Intro]
Bm  D  A  C  G  A   2 times
 
 
[Verse]
Bm        D               A             C
 I have a problem that I cannot explain
            G             A                    Bm
 I have no reason why it should have been so plain
          D               A               C
 Have no questions but I sure have excuse
             G             A              Bm
 I lack the reason why I should be so confused
 
 
[Chorus]
    F#    A      G       A           Bm
 I know, how I feel when I'm around you
    F#          A     G        A          Bm
 I don't know, how I feel when I'm around you
 
Bm  D  A  C  G  A
                Around you,
 
 
[Verse]
Bm        D               A             C
 Left a message but it ain't a bit of use,
            G             A                    Bm
 I have some pictures, the wild might be the deuce,
          D               A               C
 Today you saw, you saw me, you explained,
             G             A              Bm
 Playing the show and running down the plane,
 
 
[Chorus]
     F#    A      G       A           Bm
 I know, how I feel when I'm around you
    F#          A     G        A          Bm
 I don't know, how I feel when I'm around you
 
     F#    A      G       A           Bm
 I,I know, how I feel when I'm around you
    F#          A     G        A          Bm
 I don't know, how I feel when I'm around you

 I don't know, how I feel when I'm around you
 
     F#    A      G       A           Bm
 I,I know, how I feel when I'm around you
    F#          A     G        A          Bm
 I don't know, how I feel when I'm around you
 
Around you, around you, around you, around you
