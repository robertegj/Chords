[Verse 1]
            G              Em           Am                 D
I come from scientists and atheists and white men who kill God
              Am          D           G           Em
They make technology high quality, complex, physiological
  G             D                G              Em
Experiments and sacrilege in the name of public good
               Am               D            G
They taught me everything, just like a daddy should
 
 
[Verse 2]
             G             Em              Am          D
And you were beautiful and vulnerable and power and success
            Am                 D                   G                 Em
God damn, I fell for you, your flamethrowers, your tunnels, and your tech
          Am             D            B7                   Em
I studied code because I wanted to do something great like you
             Am         D              G
And the real tragеdy is half of it was true
 
 
[Bridge 1]
                       Am           D                G             Em
But we've been fuckin' mеan, we're elitist, we're as flawed as any church
         Am                  D           G                  Em
And this faux-rad West coast dogma has a higher fuckin' net worth
          Am             D
I bit the apple 'cause I trusted you
   B7                 Em
It tastes like Thomas Malthus
        Am         D            G    Em
Your proposal is immodest and insane
           Am              D                 G    Em
And I hope someday Selmers rides her fuckin' train
 
 
[Chorus]
  Am           D            G               Em
I loved you, I loved you, I loved you, it's true
  Am        D          G           Em
I wanted to be you and do what you do
  Am            D             B7             Em
I lived here, I loved here, I thought it was true
          Am     D       G    Em
I feel so stupid, and so used
Am  D       G    Em
  I feel so used
 
 
[Verse 3]
           Am               D                  G               Em
I was your baby, your first born, the hot girl in your compsci class
      Am                   D                     G                   Em
I was darwin's prep school dream bred, born, and raised to kick your ass
           Am              D             B7              Em
I fell for circuit boards, rocket ships, pictures of the stars
             Am           D               G
If you could only be what you pretend you are
 
 
[Verse 4]
            Am             D            G              Em
When I said take me to the moon I never meant take me alone
             Am                 D                 G               Em
I thought if mankind toured the sky it meant that all of us could go
            Am            D                     B7                Em
But I don't wanna see the stars if they're just one more piece of land
          Am           D             G
For us to colonize for us to turn to sand
 
 
[Bridge 2]
                        Am              D                G             Em
'Cause we're so fuckin' mean, we're so elitist, we're as fucked as any church
         Am                  D           G                  Em
And this bullshit West coast dogma has a higher fuckin' net worth
          Am             D              B7            Em
I bit the apple 'cause I loved you, and why would you lie?
           Am                   D                G
And then I realized that you're just as naïve as I am
              Am             D                G
Oh, you're so traumatized it makes me want to cry
 
You dumb bitch
 
 
[Chorus]
  Am           D            G               Em
I loved you, I loved you, I loved you, it's true
  Am        D          G           Em
I wanted to be you and do what you do
  Am            D             B7              Em
I lived here, I loved here, I bought it, it's true
         Am       D         G
I'm so embarrassed, I feel abused
 
 
[Verse 5]
             Am              D                 G             Em
Well I don't want to eat the rich, I'd have to eat my heroes first
         Am              D                G                  Em
And my tuition's paid by blood, I might deserve your fate or worse
            Am                 D                   B7             Em
But I don't need your god damn money, I don't need jack shit from you
          Am                  D                 G
So when I speak, you bet your life my words are true
 
 
[Verse 6]
       Am             D               G             Em
Let me level with you man, as someone guilty of the game
           Am               D                G               Em
I took the help, I took the cash, I would've taken your last name
      Am          D                   B7                Em
So if any girl on Earth should get to make a call about this,
             Am           D                G
it should be me, and as I see it, you're a dick
 
 
[Bridge 3]
             Am                 D               G                  Em
So fuck your tunnels, fuck your cars, fuck your rockets, fuck your cars again
    Am                D                 G            Em
You promised you'd be Tesla, but you're just another Edison
       Am            D               B7              Em
'Cause Tesla broke a patent, all you ever broke were hearts
          Am             D         G
I can't believe you tore humanity apart
         Em          Am                     D                  G
With the very same machines that could have been our brand new start
 
And the worst part is
 
 
[Chorus]
  Am           D            G               Em
I loved you, I loved you, I loved you, it's true
    Am          D           G             Em
And sometimes I feel like I still fuckin' do
  Am            D             B7             Em
I lived here, I loved here, I thought it was true
       Am          D        G    Em
I'm so embarrassed, I feel abused
Am D       G   Em
I  feel so used
Am D       G   Em
I  feel so used
Am      D      G  Em
Take me to the moon
Am D       G   Em
I  feel so used
Am D       G
I  feel so used
