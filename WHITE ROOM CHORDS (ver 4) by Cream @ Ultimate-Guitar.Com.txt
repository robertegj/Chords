White Room chords  (version 1)
Cream  1968 Wheels of Fire (Jack Bruce and Pete Brown)
 
Capo V
 
Dm C Am G
Dm C Am G  G7
 
       A          G           D        F         A       G F G
In the white room, with black curtains, near the station.
           A      G         D        F       A         G F G
Black roof country, no gold pavements, tired starlings.
       A      G         D        F         A         G F G
Silver horses, ran down moonbeams, in your dark eyes.
           A      G       D       F      A        G F G
Dawn light smiles, on you leaving, my contentment.
 
     G            D               F         E
I'll wait in this place where the sun never shines;
G            D               F       G            A
Wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves.
 
         A          G        D        F       A       G F G
You said no strings, could secure you, at the station.
         A      G         D       F        A       G F G
Platform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windows.
         A   G        D        F       A       G F G
I walked into, such a sad time, at the station.
     A          G        D        F       A       G F G
As I walked out, felt my own need, just beginning.
 
     G           D              F           E
I'll wait in the queue when the trains come by;
G        D             F       G            A
Lie with you where the shadows run from themselves.
 
Dm C Am G
Dm C Am G  G7
 
       A     G        D        F       A         G F G
At the party, she was kindness, in the hard crowd.
     A     G         D         F       A       G F G
Consolation, for the old wound, now forgotten.
       A      G         D         F        A        G F G
Yellow tigers, crouched in jungles, in her dark eyes.
          A        G        D       F      A        G F G
Now she's dressing, goodbye windows, tired starlings.
 
     G             D              F      E
I'll sleep in this place with the lonely crowd;
G          D              F       G            A
Lie in the dark where the shadows run from themselves.
 
Dm C Am G
