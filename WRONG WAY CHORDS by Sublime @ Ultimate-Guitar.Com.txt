[Verse 1]
 
E                               D
Annie's twelve years old in two more she'll be a whore.
E                              D
Nobody ever told her it's the wrong way.
E                       D
Don't be afraid, at the quickness you get laid.
E                                  D
For your family gets paid. It's the wrong way.
A                    G
I gave her all that I had to give.
A                 G
I'm gonna make it hard to live.
A                      G
Big salty tears running down her chin,
A                          C
and it ruins up her make up I never wanted.
F#          E
A cigarette pressed between her lips,
       F#                           E
but I'm staring at her tits, it's the wrong way.
F#                   E
strong if i can but i am only a man
   F#                            E
so i take her to the can its the wrong way
B                    A
The only family that she's ever had.
        B                            A
Was her seven horny brothers and her drunk-ass Dad.
 B                    A
He needed money so he put her on the street.
     B                            D
Everything was going fine till the day she met me.
E                 D
Happy are you sad? Wanna shoot your Dad.
       E                        D
I'll do anything I can. It's the wrong way.
 E                  D
We talked all night, try to make it right.
E                                  D
Believe me shit was tight, It's the wrong way.
A                   G
So run away if don't wanna stay.
     A                       G
But I ain't here to make you. (Oh no!)
   A                   G
It's up to you what you really wanna do.
          A                 C
Spend some time in America dub style

[Verse 2]
 
B                             A
She'll give you all that she's got to give.
B                A
I'm gonna make it hard to live.
 B                     A
Big salty tears running down her chin,
      B                       D
and it ruins all her make up I never wanted.
E                      D
So we ran away, and I'm sorry when I say,
           E                    D
that to this very day it was the wrong way.
   E               D
She took a hike, it don't matter if I like it or not.
E                      D
Cuz' she only wants the wrong way.
B                     A
I give her all that I had to give.
   B                       A
She still wouldn't take it. (Oh no!)
 B                    A
Her two brown eyes are leaking like a sieve.
       B                          D
But it still ruins her make up and everyone gives.
