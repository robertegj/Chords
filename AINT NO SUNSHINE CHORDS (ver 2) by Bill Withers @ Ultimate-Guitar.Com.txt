*from 'Just As I Am' (1971)*
 
 
Intro:
 
Am  Em  G (x2)
 
Verse 1:
 
(n.C)                         Am   Em  G
 Ain't no sunshine when she's gone,
Am        Em   G            Am  Em  G
 It's not warm when she's a-way.
Am        Em       G          Em7
 Ain't no sunshine when she's gone,
          Ebm7            Dm7                      Am  Em  G, Am
And she's always gone too long, anytime she goes a-way.
 
Verse 2:
 
Am      Em        G           Am   Em  G
 Wonder this time where she's gone,
Am      Em       G       Am   Em   G
 Wonder if she's gone to stay.
Am        Em       G          Em7
 Ain't no sunshine when she's gone,
                    Ebm7     Dm7                      Am  Em  G, Am
And this house just ain't no home, anytime she goes a-way.
 
Break:
 
Am (n.C)
 And I know, I know, I know, I know,
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know,
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know,
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know,
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know,
I know, I know...
 
(n.C)
 Hey, I oughta leave young thing alone,
                                 Am   Em  G
But ain't no sunshine when she's gone.
 
Verse 3:
 
Am    Em       G     Am  Em  G
 Only darkness every-day.
Am        Em       G          Em7
 Ain't no sunshine when she's gone,
                    Ebm7     Dm7                      Am  Em  G, Am
And this house just ain't no home, anytime she goes a-way.

Am   Em    G          Am  Em  G
 Any-time, she goes a-way,
Am   Em    G          Am  Em  G
 Any-time, she goes a-way,
Am   Em    G          Am  Em  G, Am
 Any-time, she goes a-way.
