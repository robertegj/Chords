[Verse 1]
 
Em                      A   Asus4 A
Breathe, breathe in the air,
Em                 A   Asus4 A
Don't be afraid to care
Em                     A  Asus4 A
Leave, but don't leave me 
Em                      A          Asus4 A
Look around choose your own ground
 
 
[Chorus 1]
 
Cmaj7/G
For long you'll live and high you fly
Bm
and smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry
Fmaj7
and all you touch and all you see
G6                    D7#9 D7b9
Is all your life will ever be
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
Em          A   Asus4 A
Run, rabbit run,
Em                        A   Asus4 A
dig that hole, forget the sun
Em                           A    Asus4 A
and when at last the work is done,
Em                             A           Asus4 A
don't sit down its time to dig another one
 
 
[Chorus 2]
 
Cmaj7/G
For long you'll live and high you'll fly,
Bm
But only if you ride the tide,
Fmaj7
And balanced on the biggest wave,
G6                 D7#9  D7b9
You race toward an early grave
 
[END]
Em
