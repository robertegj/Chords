Nirvana - Polly
Nevermind
 
(He plays the chords in a choppy way
with palm mutes here and there)
 
 
[Intro]
Em  G  D  C
Em  G  D  C
 
(mild distortion)
 
[Verse]
Em G       D          C
   Polly wants a cracker
Em G                    D      C
   I think I should get off her first
Em G          D            C
   Think she wants some water
Em G           D      C
   To put out the blow torch
 
[Chorus]
D    C
     Isn't me
G    Bb
     Have a seed
D    C
     Let me clip
G    Bb
     Your dirty wings
D    C
     Let me take a ride
G    Bb
     Cut yourself
D    C
     Want some help
G    Bb
     Please myself
D    C
     Got some rope
G    Bb
     Haven't told
D    C
     Promise you
G    Bb
     Have been true
D    C
     Let me take a ride
G    Bb
     Cut yourself
D    C
     Want some help
G    Bb
     Please myself
 
[Instrumental]
Em  G  D  C
Em  G  D  C
 
[Verse]
Em G      D           C
   Polly wants a cracker
Em G        D            C
   Maybe she would like some food
Em G          D         C
   She ask me to untie her
Em G              D       C
   A chase would be nice for a few
 
[Chorus]
D    C
     Isn't me
G    Bb
     Have a seed
D    C
     Let me clip
G    Bb
     Your dirty wings
D    C
     Let me take a ride
G    Bb
     Cut yourself
D    C
     Want some help
G    Bb
     Please myself
D    C
     Got some rope
G    Bb
     Haven't told
D    C
     Promise you
G    Bb
     Have been true
D    C
     Let me take a ride
G    Bb
     Cut yourself
D    C
     Want some help
G    Bb
     Please myself

Polly said
 
[Verse]
Em G           D        C
   Polly says her back hurts
Em G          D        C
   She's just as bored as me
Em G          D      C
   She caught me off my guard
Em G      D              C
   Amazes me, the will  of instinct
 
[Chorus]
D    C
     Isn't me
G    Bb
     Have a seed
D    C
     Let me clip
G    Bb
     Your dirty wings
D    C
     Let me take a ride
G    Bb
     Cut yourself
D    C
     Want some help
G    Bb
     Please myself
D    C
     Got some rope
G    Bb
     Haven't told
D    C
     Promise you
G    Bb
     Have been true
D    C
     Let me take a ride
G    Bb
     Cut yourself
D    C
     Want some help
G    Bb
     Please myself
