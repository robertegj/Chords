| Am  C C6 | G  D  C |
 
[Verse 1]
Am              C                    C6   G
I kind of wanna throw my phone across the room
                     D         C          Am
'cause all I see are girls too good to be true
                 C            C6      G
with paper-white teeth and perfect bodies,
              D       C
wish I didn't care, I know their
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Am       C    C6 G        D        C
beauty's not my lack, but it feels like that
Am        C   C6 G          D         N.C.
weight is on my back, and I can't let it go
 
[Chorus]
Am         C   C6 G           D  C
Com-comparison is killing me slowly
  Am                C     C6   G              D    C
I think I think too much 'bout kids who don't know me
Am               C    C6   G                  D  C
I'm so sick of myself, I'd rather be, rather be
Am             C    C6   G                D         C
Anyone, anyone else, but jealousy, jealousy started following
Am       C     C6    G     D         C
me, hehehe, hee              started following
Am       C     C6    G     D         C
me, hehehe, hee
 
[Verse 2]
    Am             C                      C6 G
And I see everyone getting all the things I want,
              D              C         Am
I'm happy for them, but then again I'm not
                  C                 C6    G
Just cool vintage clothes and vacation photos,
                      D            C
I can't stand it, oh, God, I sound crazy
 
[Pre-Chorus]
      Am     C    C6 G    D           C
Their win is not my loss, I know it's true,
      Am         C    C6 G      D        C
but I can't help getting caught up in it all
 
[Chorus]
N.C. Am         C   C6 G           D  C
  Co-com-comparison is killing me slowly
  Am                C     C6   G              D    C
I think I think too much 'bout kids who don't know me
Am               C    C6   G                  D  C
I'm so sick of myself, I'd rather be, rather be
Am             C    C6   G                D      C
Anyone, anyone else, but jealousy, jealousy, yeaheah
 
[Bridge]
         Am7                         C
All your friends are so cool, you go out every night
   C6   G                              D          C
in your daddy's nice car, yeah, you're living the life
      Am7                 C
Got a pretty face, pretty boyfriend, too,
  C6 G                         D         C
I wanna be you so bad and I don't even know you
Am7               C           C6
All I see is what I should be:
 G                 D         C
Happier, prettier, jealousy, jealousy
Am7               C           C6
All I see is what I should be
    G                      D         C
I'm losing it, all I get's jealousy, jealousy
 
[Chorus]
A5  A5     C   C6 G5 G5       D  C
Com-comparison is killing me slowly
  A5    A5          C     C6   G5   G5        D N.C.
I think I think too much 'bout kids who don't know me
Am               C    C6   G                  D  C
I'm so sick of myself, I'd rather be, rather be   (aohaoh)
Am             C    C6   G                D         C
Anyone, anyone else, but jealousy, jealousy        (ooohh)
Am               C    C6   G                  D  C
I'm so sick of myself, I'd rather be, rather be   (ah, oh, oh)
Am             C    C6   G                D         C         N.C.
Anyone, anyone else, but jealousy, jealousy started following me
