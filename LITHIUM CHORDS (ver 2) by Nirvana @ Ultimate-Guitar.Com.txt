Notes: In the original version the whole song is played in dropped D and begins
       with an E chord. If you want to play like in the original, you must tune your
       guitar one step down and transpose the chords one step up.
       You can mute strings in the intro and verse and play normally in the 'yeah'
       lines - it will make playing more dynamic.
