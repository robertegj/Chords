Am          F           C            G
I wrote her off for the tenth time today
Am           F       C               G
And practice all the things I would say
Am            F    C            G
When she came over I lost my nerve
Am         F        C            G
I took her back and made her dessert
Am    F    C            G
Now I know I'm being used
Am      F               C          G
That's okay man cause I like the abuse
Am   F       C              G
I know she's playing with me
Am      F                C           G
That's okay 'cause I got no self esteem

Am      F        C            G
We make plans to go out at night
Am          F        C             G
I wait till 2 then I turn out the light
Am         F         C         G
All this rejection's got me so low
Am              F          C             G
If she keeps it up I just might tell her so

[Chorus]
Dm         Bb     F           C
When she's saying oh that she wants only me
Dm     Bb              F               C
Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends
Dm         Bb     F           C
When she's saying oh that I'm like a disease
Dm     Bb              F               C
Then I wonder how much more I can spend
Dm     Bb    F              C
Well I Guess I should stick up for myself
Dm     Bb               F            C
But I really think it's better this way
Dm            Bb     C           G                 F
The more you suffer, the more it shows you really care 
       G
Right? Yeah yeah yeah...

Am         F    C           G
Now I'll relate this little bit
Am           F             C         G
That happens more than I'd like to admit
Am      F         C            G
Late at night she knocks on my door
Am           F        C          G
She's drunk again and looking to score
Am     F   C              G
Now I know I should say no
    Am             F                C        G
But that's kind of hard when she's ready to go
Am       F         C          G
I may be dumb, but I'm not a dweeb
Am          F          C           G
I'm just a sucker with no self esteem

       G              Am
Right? Yeah yeah yeah...
