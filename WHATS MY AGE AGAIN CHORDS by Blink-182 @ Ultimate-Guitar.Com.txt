[Intro]
 
B  F#  C#  D#m  x4
 
[Verse 1]
 
B            F#
  I took her out
C#         D#m
  it was a Friday night
B          F#
  I wore cologne
C#           D#m
  to get the feeling right
B            F#
  We started making out
C#             D#m
  and she took off my pants
B            F#             C#
  But then I turned on the TV
 
[Chorus 1]
 
    B
And that's about the
                 F#
time she walked away from
C# D#m        B
me     Nobody likes you
            F#     C#
when you're twenty-three
D#m             B
  And are still more
          F# C#
amused by TV shows
D#m              B
What the hell is ADD?
   F#
My friends say I
       C#
should act my age
D#m
  What's my age again?
C#
  What's my age again?
 
[Post-Chorus]
 
B  F#  C#  D#m
 
[Verse 2]
 
B            F#
  Then later on
C#       D#m
  on the drive home
B              F#
  I called her mom
C#       D#m
  from a pay phone
B          F#
  I said I was the cops
C#            D#m
  And your husband's in jail
B
 This state looks
F#          C#
down on sodomy
 
[Chorus 2]
 
    B
And that's about the time
                F#    C#
that bitch hung up on me
D#m      B
  Nobody likes you when
       F#     C#
you're twenty-three
D#m             B
  And are still more amused
   F#          C#
by prank phone calls
D#m              B
What the hell is caller ID?
   F#                   C#
My friends say I should act
      D#m
my age What's my age again?
C#
  What's my age again?
 
[Interlude]
 
D#m  C#  B  C#  x3
D#m  C#  B  B
 
[Chorus 3]
 
    C#
And that's about the time
            F#       C#
she walked away from me
D#m      B
  Nobody likes you when
       F#     C#
you're twenty-three
D#m             B
  And you still act like
          F#
you're in Freshman
C#   D#m
year What the hell
   B
is wrong with me?
   F#
My friends say I
       C#
should act my age
D#m
  What's my age again?
 
[Chorus 4]
 
    C#
And that's about the
               F#
time she broke up with
C# D#m              B
me    No one should take
              F#     C#
themselves so seriously
D#m         B
  With many years
         F#
ahead to fall in
C#   D#m
line Why would you
     B
wish that on me?
  F#            C#
I never want to act my
   D#m
age What's my age again?
C#
  What's my age again?
 
[Outro]
 
F#  C#  D#m  B  x3
F#  C#  D#m  C#  B (hold)
