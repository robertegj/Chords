   Am
To me

[Bridge]
 
          Em
When I go fishing
        Am
for the words
     Em                Am
I am wishing you would say to me,
     F           C
I am really only praying that
    G                    D7
The words you'll soon be saying
      Am
Might betray
    Em           Am
The way you feel about me

Am    C    F    D7    x6
 
 
[Outro]

Coming from you,
F           D7          Am
