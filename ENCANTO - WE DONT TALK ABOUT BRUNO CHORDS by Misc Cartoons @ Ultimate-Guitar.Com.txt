[Intro]
G                    F#
 We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no
G                    F#        Bm
 We don't talk about Bruno, but
 
 
[Verse 1]
          Em
It was my wedding day
           F#
It was our wedding day
        Em
We were getting ready
          Bm       Em           F#
And there wasn't a cloud in the sky
            Em
No clouds allowed in the sky
Bm          Em        F#          Em
Bruno walks in with a mischievous grin
 
Thunder
G                            F#
You telling this story or am I?
 
I'm sorry, mi vida, go on
Bm           Em            F#
Bruno says, "It looks like rain"
           Em
Why did he tell us?
   Bm        Em           F#
In doing so, he floods my brain
            Em
Abuela, get the umbrellas
Bm           Em   F#
Married in a hurricane
              Em
What a joyous day but anyway
 
 
[Chorus]
G                    F#
 We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no
G                    F#
 We don't talk about Bruno
 
 
[Verse 2]
     Bm                      Em
Hey, grew to live in fear of Bruno stuttering or stumbling
F#                    Em
I can always hear him sort of muttering and mumbling
Bm                       Em               F#   Em
I associate him with the sound of falling sand, ch ch ch
Bm                       Em
It's a heavy lift with a gift so humbling
             F#            Em
Always left Abuela and the family fumbling
G                                            F#
Grappling with prophecies they couldn't understand
 
Do you understand?
Bm           Em     F#             Em
A seven-foot frame, rats along his back
        Bm         Em      F#           Em
When he calls your name it all fades to black
         Bm        Em         F#             Em
Yeah, he sees your dreams and feasts on your screams (Hey)
 
 
[Chorus]
G                    F#
 We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no
G                    F#
 We don't talk about Bruno
 
 
[Bridge]
Bm            Em                            F#
He told me my fish would die, the next day, dead (No, no)
Bm             Em                          F#
He told me I'd grow a gut and just like he said (No, no)
             Bm                Em                         F#
He said that all my hair would disappear, now, look at my head (No, no)
G                             F#
Your fate is sealed when your prophecy is read
 
 
[Verse 3]
D                   A
He told me that the life of my dreams
         Bm                       G
Would be promised, and someday be mine
   D               A
He told me that my power would grow
         Bm                        G
Like the grapes that thrive on the vine (Óye, Mariano's on his way)
D                   A
He told me that the man of my dreams
         Bm
Would be just out of reach
  G
Betrothed to another
D                     A
It's like I hear him, now
         Bm                        G
Hey sis, I want not a sound out of you
 
It's like I can hear him now, I can hear him, now
G   F#
Um, Bruno
G                F#
Yeah, about that Bruno
  G                         F#
I really need to know about Bruno
          G                   F#            Gm
Gimme the truth and the whole truth, Bruno (Isabela, your boyfriend's here)
 
Time for dinner
 
 
[Verse 4]
Bm           Em     F#             Em
A seven-foot frame, rats along his back (It was my wedding day, it was our wedding day)
        Bm         Em      F#           Em
When he calls your name it all fades to black (We were getting ready and there wasn't a cloud in the sky)
         Bm        Em         F#             Em
Yeah, he sees your dreams and feasts on your screams (Bruno walks in with a mischievous grin)
G                            F#
You telling this story or am I? (Óye, Mariano's on his way)
Bm           Em            F#                                   Em
Bruno says, "It looks like rain" (He told me that the man of my dreams would be just out of reach)
   Bm        Em           F#                            Em
In doing so, he floods my brain (Betrothed to another, another)
Bm           Em   F#                                                  Em
Married in a hurricane (And I'm fine, and I'm fine, and I'm fine, I'm fine)
     G
He's here
 
 
[Outro]
                 F#
Don't talk about Bruno, no
                     G
Why did I talk about Bruno?
                 F#
Not a word about Bruno
                                Bm
I never shoulda brought up Bruno
