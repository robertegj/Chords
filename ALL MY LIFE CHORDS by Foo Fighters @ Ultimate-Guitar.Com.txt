[Verse]
G5
All my life Ive been searching for somethin
 
Somethin never comes, never leads to nuthin
 
Nothin satisfies, but Im gettin close
 
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope
 
All night long I dream of the day
 
When it comes around, and its takin away
 
Leaves me with the feelin that I fear the most
 
Feel it come to life when I see your ghost

G5                      A5
Calm down, dont you resist
G5                      Bb5
Your such a delicate rist
G5                      A5
And if I give it a twist
G5                       Bb5
Somethin to hold when I lose my grip
G5                         A5
Will I find something in there,
G5                         Bb5
To give it just what it need
G5                         A5
Another reason to bleed
G5
One by one, hidden up my sleeve
G5
One by one, hidden up my sleeve
 
 Eb/G
Hey, dont let it go to waste
G5
I love it but, I hate that taste
C/E  F          Bb
Weight keeping me down
 
[Link 2] Gm        Gm Am      Gm        Gm  Bbm
 
G5                   A5
Will I find the believer
G5                    Bb5
Another one who believes
G5                    A5
Another one to decieve
G5                     Bb5
Over and over, down on my knees
G5                 A5
If I get any closer, 
G5                  Bb5
And if you open up wide
G5                  A5
And if you let me inside
G5
On and on, Ive got nuthin to hide
G5
On and on Ive got nuthin to hide
 
Eb/G
Hey, dont let it go to waste
G5
I love it but, I hate that taste
C/E    F            Bb
Weight pinning me down

Done, done; on to the next one

Done, done, and Im on to the next one

Done, done, and Im on to the next one
[2x]
Done, done, and Im on the next one
Done, Im done, and Im on to the next
