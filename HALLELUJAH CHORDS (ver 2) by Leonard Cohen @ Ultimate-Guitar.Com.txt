HALLELUJAH
Leonard Cohen
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
  C          C/B    Am
I heard there was a secret chord      
     C            C/B    Am
that David played and it pleased the Lord
    F                G              C    G
But you don't really care for music do ya
   C                  F          G
It goes like this the fourth the fifth
    Am                 F
the minor fall and the major lift
    G                E          Am
The baffled king composing hallelujah
     F           Am          F           C G C  G
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
     C                C/B     Am
Your faith was strong but you needed proof
    C       C/B     Am
You saw her bathing on the roof
    F              G              C      G
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
    C             F       G
She tied you to a kitchen chair
    Am                         F
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
    G                  E             Am
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
      F          Am           F          C G C  G
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
C          C/B  Am
Maybe I've been here before
  C              C/B Am
I know this room Ive walked this floor
  F              G            C       G
I used to live alone before I knew you
     C                     F      G
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
    Am            F
But Love is not a victory march
       G               E           Am
It’s a cold and it’s a broken hallelujah
     F           Am           F          C G C  G
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
 
 
[Verse 4]
 
      C          C/B Am
There was a time you let me know
       C        C/B   Am
What's real and going on below
    F             G             C     G
But now you never show it to me do you?
     C            F        G
I remember when I moved in you
    Am            F
The holy dark was moving too
    G               E             Am
And every breath we drew was hallelujah
     F           Am          F           C G C  G
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
 
 
[Verse 5]
 
C          C/B  Am
Maybe there’s a God above
    C     C/B  Am
But all I ever learned from love
    F               G               C      G
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
    C                    F       G
Its not the cry that you hear at night
     Am                F
It's not someone who's seen the light
       G               E           Am
It’s a cold and it’s a broken hallelujah
     F           Am          F           C G C  G
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
 
 
[Verse 6]
 
    C          C/B Am
You say I took the name in vain
    C       C/B  Am
But I don't even know the name
    F              G                 C     G
But if I did, well really, what's it to ya?
          C                 F     G
There's a blaze of light in every word
   Am              F
It doesn't matter which you heard
    G           E           Am
The holy or the broken Hallelujah
     F           Am          F           C G C  G
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
 
 
[Verse 7]
 
  C          C/B  Am
I did my best, it wasn't much
  C              C/B  Am
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
     F                 G              C      G
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool ya
    C              F        G
And even though it all went wrong
     Am               F
I'll stand before the Lord of Song
     G             E               Am
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah
 
 
[Outro]
 
     F           Am          F            C G
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelu
     F           Am          F            C G
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelu
     F           Am          F            C G
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelu
     F           Am          F           C G C
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelu--jah
